Re: auto-run script at boot time in c7
Postby jensd Â» 2014/08/27 11:48:10

/etc/rc.local or /etc/rc.d/rc.local are no longer executed by default due to systemd-changes.
to still use those, you need to make /etc/rc.d/rc.local executable:
CODE: SELECT ALL
chmod +x /etc/rc.d/rc.local


If the script is executable, it should be executed at boot when you add a line containing
CODE: SELECT ALL
/root/red5-screens.sh

to /etc/rc.local (which is a symlink to /etc/rc.d/rc.local)
to be sure that your script is executable, just do a chmod +x /root/red5-screens.sh

To debug your problem, it would be a good idea to redirect the output of the script (if there is any) to a logfile to be sure if the script has been executed or not.
